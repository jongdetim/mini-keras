- error depends on learning rate only when doing stochastic! why??? >check SGD function
    + probably because in SGD, multiple learning steps are made before error is reported,
        so higher learning rate means bigger steps & potentially lower average error? but then why does error increase with low LR?
    + only happens with high learning rates
- accuracy function
- pass seed to model on init
